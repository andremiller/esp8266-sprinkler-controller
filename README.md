# esp8266-sprinkler-controller
A Web based sprinkler controller using the ESP8266

Versions of software used:

Arduino IDE 1.6.5
Boards Manager: esp8266 by ESP8266 Community version 2.0.0
Library Manager: DallasTemperature by Miles Burton, Tim Newsome, Guil Barros, Rob Tillaart Version 3.7.5

Eagle 7.5.0 Light (Free Version)

I used an ESP-03 module in this project, but if you want to get the OTA firmware update to work you need to use a module with more flash memory. (It works just fine without OTA updates)
